    Let $U$ be an optimization problem. Let, for a given instance $x \in L_I$ of
    size $n$, every $\alpha \in \left\{0,1\right\}^n$ represent a feasible
    solution to $x$ (i.e. $\M(x) = \left\{0,1\right\}^n$). A {\bf schema for
      $\M(x)$} is any vector $s = (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n) \in
    \left\{0,1,*\right\}^n$. A {\bf set of feasible solutions of a schema}
      $\mathbf{s = (s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n)}$ is {\em
    $\mathbf{Schema(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n)} = \{\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \ldots

    The {\bf length of a schema \textit{s}}, denoted $\mathbf{length(s)}$, is
    the distance between the first and the last non-$*$ position in $s$. The
    {\bf order of a schema \textit{s}}, denoted $\mathbf{order(s)}$, is the
    number of non-$*$ positions. The {\bf fitness of a schema $\mathbf{s = (s_1,
        s_2, \ldots, s_n)}$ in a population \textit{P}} is the average fitness
    of feasible solutions in $Schema(s)$, i.e. \newline
    $\displaystyle\mathbf{Fitness(s, P)} = \cfrac{1}{|Schema(s) \cap P|} \cdot
    \sum_{\gamma \in Schema(s) \cap P} cost(\gamma)$ \vspace{1mm}\newline
