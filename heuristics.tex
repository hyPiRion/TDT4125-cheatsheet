  $\mathbf{LSS(Neigh)}$ & Local search scheme in the neighbourhood $Neigh$,
  always picking the best neighbour. \\ \hline
  \bf multistart \newline local search & $LSS(Neigh)$ with multiple random
  initial starting points. \\ \hline
  \bf threshold \newline local search & $LSS$ but allows to move to a weaker
  solution than the current when the deteriotation is not above a given
  threshold. \\ \hline
  \bf simulated \newline annealing & As $LSS$, but with a random pick and a
  probability of picking a worse solution, based on a temperature $T$. \\ \hline
