    What follows are five subclasses of the class NPO.
    \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\bf NPO(\Roman{enumi})}
    \begin{enumeratex} \addtolength{\itemindent}{9mm}
    \item Contains every optimization problem from NPO for which there exists a
      FPTAS. \newline Example: Knapsack problem.
    \item Contains every optimization problem from NPO that has a PTAS.
      \newline Example: Makespan scheduling problem.
    \item Contains every optimization problem $U \in NPO$ such that
      \begin{enumeratex}
      \item there is a polynomial-time $\delta$-approximation algorithm for some
        $\delta > 1$, and
      \item there is no polynomial-time $d$-approximation algorithm for $U$ for
        some $d < \delta$ (possibly under some reasonable assumption like $P
        \neq NP$), i.e. there is no PTAS for $U$.
      \end{enumeratex}
      Examples: Min. vertex cover prob, {\sc Max-Sat}, {\sc $\Delta$-TSP}
    \item Contains every $U \in NPO$ such that
      \begin{enumeratex}
      \item there is a polynomial-time $f(n)$-approximation algorithm for $U$
        for some $f : \N \to \R^+$, where $f$ is bounded by a polylogarithmic
        function, and
      \item under some reasonable assumption like $P \neq NP$, there does not
        exist any polynomial-time $\delta$-approximation algorithm for $U$ for
        any $\delta \in \R^+$.
      \end{enumeratex}
      \vspace{-3mm} Examples: Set cover problem
    \item Contains every $U \in NPO$ such that if ther exists a polynomial-time
      $f(n)$-approximation algorithm for $U$, then (under some reasonable
      assumption like $P \neq NP$) $f(n)$ is not bounded by any polylogarithmic
      function.
      \newline Examples: TSP, maximum clique problem
